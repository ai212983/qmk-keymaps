= QMK Keyboards Layouts

Layouts in this repo are work in progress and most likely will be tweaked in next few months
(beginning of 2020).

There are ErgoDox EZ and Planck EZ layouts, sharing some code.
These layouts was made to be as close to each other as possible.

Both layouts are using Mac OS X Unicode Hex Input for Cyrillic.

https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally[`Wally`] is used for flashing.


== Backlog
 - Lock LOWER by tapping (it is also ESC, so not compatible with built-in TT)
 - Windows management
 - Generate layout PNGs
 - also check Issues section for already planned features

== Can be better, but its ok for now
 - Left hand is overloaded a bit because of nav keys
 - *-+/ symbols are not too convinient
 - There is a LOT of unused keys for ErgoDox EZ

== References
 - https://git.io/Je9NM[superduper mode] - activating layer by S+D
 - https://git.io/Je9NF[overriding shift] - like swapping ~ and `

== Some reasoning (in no particular order)
 - Navigation is bind to the left hand so right hand can use with mouse
 - Hyper should be used mostly for system-wide hotkeys, Meh for app-specific.
